## ECA

ECA stands for Event Condition Action is a shortcut name for referring to the structure of active rules in event-driven architecture and active database systems.

Such a rule traditionally consisted of three parts:

- The *event* part specifies the signal that triggers the invocation of the rule
- The *condition* part is a logical test that, if satisfied or evaluates to true, causes the action to be carried out
- The *action* part consists of updates or invocations on the local data
