# Elastic Search

## What is elastic search?

Elasticsearch is the distributed search and analytics engine at the heart of the Elastic Stack. Logstash and Beats facilitate collecting, aggregating, and enriching your data and storing it in Elasticsearch. Kibana enables you to interactively explore, visualize, and share insights into your data and manage and monitor the stack. Elasticsearch is where the indexing, search, and analysis magic happens.

While not *every* problem is a search problem, Elasticsearch offers speed and flexibility to handle data in a wide variety of use cases:

- Add a search box to an app or website
- Store and analyze logs, metrics, and security event data
- Use machine learning to automatically model the behavior of your data in real-time
- Automate business workflows using Elasticsearch as a storage engine
- Manage, integrate, and analyze spatial information using Elasticsearch as a geographic information system (GIS)
- Store and process genetic data using Elasticsearch as a bioinformatics research tool
