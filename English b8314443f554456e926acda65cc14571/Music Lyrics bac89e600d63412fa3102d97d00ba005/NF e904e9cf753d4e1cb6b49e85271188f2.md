# Wake Up

You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape.

Because you live `your` life in a comma, you're never awake. `(It's not because it is 'Cause)`

If you`'d` open your eyes, then maybe you'd see what's `at stake`

You're sleeping (2)

You make a lot of money and live in `a` mansion.

`And` pretty much `got` everything you could `ever` imagine.

But you feel like even `though` you got everything in the world, ~~but~~ you `got` nothing.

So what you do `then` is `you start` going backward.

You~~'re~~ running `in a direction` and you~~'re~~ looking for something that is not real.

`And all` you know `is that` You~~'re~~ just `gotta` have it. 

What you`'re doing` is sleeping and thinking that you`'re awake and you're not` 

`And the`problem `is` that you `don't know what you're` after.

`So`, you put everything you `have into` what you do, `hoping` that ~~in~~ one day ~~you~~ maybe `you` don't have to feel `like you're` empty.

But as you get older, a lot of weight on your shoulder`s` is getting heavy.

Then you look ~~things~~ back and `you` start `to` regret things.

You only get one life and every time you~~'re~~ looking at yours, you feel `like` everything you have is a waste.

And the problem and the reason you `could never fill a hole in` your whole life is because you~~'re~~ were never awake.

You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape.

Because you live `your` life in a comma, you're never awake.

Wake up! (16)

You wake up in the morning but `you` feel `like` you've never got up and go to work and you feel`ing` like `you ain't` got `a` purpose.

And you~~'re~~ trying to get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess like you~~'re~~ `ain't` nothing but worthless.

And `yo`, you look around ~~and~~ `A` lot of these other people you~~'re~~ looking at, to you, you describe as perfect.

So you point `a` finger `at` god and tell him to do his job, and fix your life up because nothing is working.

And you `will` try~~ing~~ to hide it `and` make it seem~~s~~ something like `it's nothing, but` really `you` feel `like everything is` crashing around you.

And you developed `a` problem `in` trusting `in other` people which `later` became an issue that `would` mentally pound~~s~~ you.

You only get one life but every time you~~'re~~ looking at yours, you feel like all you ever see `are` mistake`s`.

And the problem and the reason that you `could never` move forward in life is because you `were` never awake. Wake up!

You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape.

Because you live `your` life in a comma, you're never awake.

Wake up! (16)

You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape. escape(3)

Because you live `your` life in a comma, you're never awake. 

# Remember This

Yeah, they say when `we` grow up. You'll understand when you're `older`.

`guess` I'm still a kid, I don't know it. If I'll ever let go of this, say goodbye to the old me. 

We `ain't` friends anymore, You don't know me. I know I could die any moment. If I do, just remember `this`.

`Yeah, handouts create` lazy people I'm not impressed with.

You want something in life, `then` why don't you go and get it?

`Actions speak louder than words do`, it's pretty quiet, isn't it?

Look at the world we live in, `defined by` the comment section.

Surround yourself with people `that challenge` how you think.

Not people `that nod their` head `and` act `as like` they agree.

Those people `that cut you open` just to watch you bleed.

Always be yourself, not the person you pretend to be. no!

These people are going to tell you `that you. will` never make it.

`Then` when you do, they `gonna` say they knew you `were going places`.

That just `how it works`, next thing you know `you'll` be overrated, `hearing` people say they missed your old you. It's crazy, isn't it?

And perfect people don't exist, so don't pretend to be one.

`I don't need pats on the back from people` for my achievements.

When I die I wanna know I `lived` for a reason.

Anyone can take your life but not what you believe in. no!

Yeah, they say when `we` grow up. You'll understand when you're `older`.

`guess` I'm still a kid, I don't know it. If I'll ever let go of this, say goodbye to the old me. 

We `ain't` friends anymore, You don't know me. I know I could die any moment. If I do, just remember `this`.

Yeah, `don't take opinions from people that won't listen to you.`

If money is where you find happiness you are always poor.

If you don't like the job `you have`, why are you doing for?

The cure `to` the pain is `not` something you buy at a `licker store`, nah!

The real you is not defined by the size of your office.

The real you is who when `ain't` nobody watching.

You spend your whole life worried about what's in your wallet?

For what? `That money won't show up in your coffin, woo!`
