# Storage

## LUN - Logical Unit Number

LUNs are used to address and manage storage at the block level and are often associated with storage area networks (SANs). They enable the operating system or server to communicate with and access specific storage resources.

## Clustered File System

A clustered file system is a type of file system that allows multiple servers or hosts to access and share the same storage simultaneously.
