# Elastic Search

## What is elastic search?

When people ask, “what is Elasticsearch?”, some may answer that it’s “an index”, “a search engine”, an “analytics database”, “a big data solution”, that “it’s fast and scalable”, or that “it’s kind of like Google”. Depending on your level of familiarity with this technology, these answers may either bring you closer to an ah-ha moment or further confuse you. But the truth is, all of these answers are correct and that’s part of the appeal of Elasticsearch. Over the years, Elasticsearch and the ecosystem of components that’s grown around it called the “Elastic Stack” has been used for a growing number of use cases, from simple search on a website or document, collecting and analyzing log data, to a business intelligence tool for data analysis and visualization.

- Elasticsearch is the distributed search and analytics engine at the heart of the Elastic Stack.
- Logstash and Beats facilitate collecting, aggregating, and enriching your data and storing it in Elasticsearch.
- Kibana enables you to interactively explore, visualize, and share insights into your data and manage and monitor the stack. Elasticsearch is where the indexing, search, and analysis magic happens.

While not *every* problem is a search problem, Elasticsearch offers speed and flexibility to handle data in a wide variety of use cases:

- Add a search box to an app or website
- Store and analyze logs, metrics, and security event data
- Use machine learning to automatically model the behavior of your data in real-time
- Automate business workflows using Elasticsearch as a storage engine
- Manage, integrate, and analyze spatial information using Elasticsearch as a geographic information system (GIS)
- Store and process genetic data using Elasticsearch as a bioinformatics research tool

# Components

To understand how elastic search works we need to lean about some concepts and components of this system.

## Logical Concepts

### Document

Documents are the basic unit of information that can be indexed in Elasticsearch expressed in JSON. You can think of a document like a row in a relational database, representing a given entity. It can be any structured data encoded in JSON.

### Indices

An index is a collection of documents that have similar characteristics. An index is the highest level entity that you can query against in Elasticsearch. You can think of the index as being similar to a database in a relational database schema. Any documents in an index are typically logically related. In the context of an e-commerce website, for example, you can have an index for Customers, one for Products, one for Orders, and so on.

### Inverted Index

An index in Elasticsearch is actually what’s called an inverted index, which is the mechanism by which all search engines work. It is a data structure that stores a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a document or a set of documents. Basically, it is a hashmap-like data structure that directs you from a word to a document. For example, in the image below, the term “best” occurs in document 2, so it is mapped to that document.

## Backend concepts

### Cluster

An Elasticsearch cluster is a group of one or more node instances that are connected together. The power of an Elasticsearch cluster lies in the distribution of tasks, searching, and indexing, across all the nodes in the cluster.

### Node

A node is a single server that is a part of a cluster. A node stores data and participates in the cluster’s indexing and search capabilities. An Elasticsearch node can be configured in different ways:

- **Master Node** — Controls the Elasticsearch cluster and is responsible for all cluster-wide operations like creating/deleting an index and adding/removing nodes.
- **Data Node** — Stores data and executes data-related operations such as search and aggregation.
- **Client Node** — Forwards cluster requests to the master node and data-related requests to data nodes.

### Shards

Elasticsearch provides the ability to subdivide the index into multiple pieces called shards. Each shard is in itself a fully-functional and independent “index” that can be hosted on any node within a cluster. By distributing the documents in an index across multiple shards, and distributing those shards across multiple nodes, Elasticsearch can ensure redundancy, which both protects against hardware failures and increases query capacity as nodes are added to a cluster.

### Replicas

Elasticsearch allows you to make one or more copies of your index’s shards which are called “replica shards” or just “replicas”. Basically, a replica shard is a copy of a primary shard. Each document in an index belongs to one primary shard. Replicas provide redundant copies of your data to protect against hardware failure and increase capacity to serve read requests like searching or retrieving a document.
