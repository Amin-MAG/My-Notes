# Kubectl

## Get started

```bash
# Installation on mac
brew install kubectl

# To check the command
kubectl version --client
```

## `kubectl` Configuration

In order for `kubectl` to find and access a Kubernetes cluster, it needs a [kubeconfig file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/), which is created automatically when you create a cluster using [kube-up.sh](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/kube-up.sh) or successfully deploy a Minikube cluster. By default, `kubectl` configuration is located at `~/.kube/config`.

## Create a cluster using MiniCube

**Kubernetes coordinates a highly available cluster of computers that are connected to work as a single unit.**

**Kubernetes automates the distribution and scheduling of application containers across a cluster in a more efficient way.**

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two types of resources:

- The **Control Plane** coordinates the cluster: **is responsible for managing the cluster.**
- **Nodes** are the workers that run applications: **A node is a VM or a physical computer that serves as a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster.** Each node has a Kubelet, which is an agent for managing the node and communicating with the Kubernetes control plane.

```bash
# Install minikube 
brew update
# hyperkit, I used hyper kit, install one of these
brew install hyperkit
# You need virtual box before
brew install --cask virtualbox
brew install minikube

# Create cluster
# Checking minikube tool
minikube version

# Start the cluster
# Using hyperkit 
minikube start --vm-driver=hyperkit

# Stop cluster
minikube stop
# Delete the whole VM 
minikube delete
```

To view cluster details

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```
