## `kubectl` Configuration

In order for `kubectl` to find and access a Kubernetes cluster, it needs a [kubeconfig file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/), which is created automatically when you create a cluster using [kube-up.sh](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/kube-up.sh) or successfully deploy a Minikube cluster. By default, `kubectl` configuration is located at `~/.kube/config`.
