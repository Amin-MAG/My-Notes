# Pods and Nodes

## Pods

A Pod is a Kubernetes abstraction that represents a group of one or more application containers (such as Docker), and some shared resources for those containers. Those resources include:

- Shared storage, as Volumes
- Networking, as a unique cluster IP address
- Information about how to run each container, such as the container image version or specific ports to use

Pods are the atomic unit on the Kubernetes platform.

Each Pod is tied to the Node where it is scheduled, and remains there until termination (according to restart policy) or deletion. In case of a Node failure, identical Pods are scheduled on other available Nodes in the cluster.

Kubernetes [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) are mortal. Pods in fact have a [lifecycle](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/). When a worker node dies, the Pods running on the Node are also lost. A [ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) might then dynamically drive the cluster back to desired state via creation of new Pods to keep your application running.

## **Nodes**

A Pod always runs on a **Node**. A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster.

Each Node is managed by the control plane. A Node can have multiple pods, and the Kubernetes control plane automatically handles scheduling the pods across the Nodes in the cluster.

Every Kubernetes Node runs at least:

- Kubelet, a process responsible for communication between the Kubernetes control plane and the Node; it manages the Pods and the containers running on a machine.
- A container runtime (like Docker) responsible for pulling the container image from a registry, unpacking the container, and running the application.
