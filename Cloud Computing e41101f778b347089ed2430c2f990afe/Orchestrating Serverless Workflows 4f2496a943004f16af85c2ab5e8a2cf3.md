# Orchestrating Serverless Workflows

# FaaS

Serverless Function as a Service (FaaS) is becoming a very popular programming model in the cloud thanks to its simplicity, billing model and inherent elasticity.

The FaaS model has also proven ideally suited for executing embarrassingly parallel computing
tasks. But both PyWren and ExCamera required their own ad-hoc external orchestration services to synchronize the parallel executions of functions.

Faas is based on event-driven programming.
