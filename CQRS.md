# CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

CQRS is an architecture pattern that separates the responsibilities for handling read and write operations in a system. It was introduced as a way to improve the scalability, performance, and maintainability of applications, particularly in scenarios where there are complex data processing and reporting requirements.

Here are some key advantages of using CQRS

1. **Scalability**: By separating the read and write concerns, CQRS allows you to scale each side independently
2. **Performance**: Since the read model is optimized for querying and can be denormalized for specific use cases, query performance can be significantly improved.
3. **Flexibility**: CQRS enables you to use different data storage technologies and models for the read and write sides, tailoring each to their specific requirements.
4. **Maintainability**: Separating the concerns of write and read operations can make the system easier to understand, extend, and maintain.
5. **Event Sourcing**: CQRS is often used in conjunction with event sourcing, a pattern where all changes to an application's state are captured as a series of immutable events. Event sourcing can be used on the command side to maintain a complete audit trail of changes and enable sophisticated analysis and debugging. [Read more about Event Sourcing](Event-Sourcing.md)

## Command Side

- It deals with the creation, modification, and deletion of data.
- It deals with the creation, modification, and deletion of data.
- It typically uses a separate data store optimized for writes, which may be different from the data store used for reading.

## Query Side

- It focuses on optimizing the retrieval and presentation of data to the user.
- The Query Side uses a data store that is optimized for read performance and may have a denormalized or tailored structure to support efficient queries.
