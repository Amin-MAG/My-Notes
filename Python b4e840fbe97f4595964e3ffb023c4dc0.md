## Method order in a class

- **Interfaces first:** Public methods and Python magic functions define the interface of the class. Most of the time, you and other developers want to use a class rather than change it. Thus they will be interested in the interface of that class. Putting it first in the source code avoids scrolling through implementation details you don't care about.
- **Properties, [magic methods](https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/), public methods:** It's hard to define the best order between those three, which are all part of the interface of the class. As @EthanFurman says, it's most important to stick with one system for the whole project. Generally, people expect `__init__()` to be the best first function in the class so I follow up with the other magic methods right below.
- **Reading order:** Basically, there are two ways to tell a story: Bottom-up or top-down. By putting high-level functions first, a developer can get a rough understanding of the class by reading the first couple of lines. Otherwise, one would have to read the whole class in order to get an understanding of the class and most developers don't have the time for that. As a rule of thumb, put methods above all methods called from their body.
- **Class methods and static methods:** Usually, this is implied by the *reading order* explained above. Normal methods can call all methods times and thus come first. Class methods can only call class methods and static methods and come next. Static methods cannot call other methods of the class and come last.
## Linter

To apply this linter you need to install the black linter.

```bash
pip3 install black
```

Then you can add this linter to your git hook.

```bash
# Enable the pre commit hook
cp ./git/hooks/pre-commit.sample ./git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Add these lines to the top of `pre-commit`:

```bash
# Linter
if command -v black
then
	black .
fi
```

# Snippets

A snippet to generate a dictionary based on another dictionary in one line:

```python
>>> a = [1,2,3,4,4,5]
>>> a = [1,2,3,4,5]
>>> b = {"a": 100, "b":200, "c": 300, "d": 400}
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> b
{'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c': 300, 'd': 400}
>>> { my_key: [x + my_value for x in range(10)] for my_key, my_value in b.items() }
{'a': [100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109], 'b': [200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209], 'c': [300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309], 'd': [400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409]}
```
