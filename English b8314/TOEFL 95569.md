# TOEFL

There are 4 main sections

1. Reading
2. Listening
3. Writing
4. Speaking

# Current Plan

In this section, I describe the current situation for each section.

## Vocabulary

Actually, I believe in this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNhZnH9bQLc&t=609s). I prefer to have more active words in my brain instead of learning many many words every day. I choose some famous TOEFL decks and start to learn them one by one. I continue this as much as I have the time. 

The way that I start learning these words is to write them in my own dictionary. I create the MOD  page (My Own Dictionary) in notion.

You can find more details on this page.

## Grammar

I choose grammar in use book (intermediate) to review the things that I have forgotten. Common mistakes in grammar are interesting too.

## Writing

Try to write daily articles + exam writing tests in the Grammarly environment. I use the Longman Essay Activator to improve both writing and speaking.

## Reading

## Listening

I use the google podcasts app and follow the Radiolab podcasts. [Zhenti Book](https://app.shayesteh.ir/toefl/books) can also help.

But the main goal is to do the TPO Listening exams and analyze them completely.

## Speaking

I try to speak to myself :) Ask me some questions. Repeating the listening tracks loudly.
