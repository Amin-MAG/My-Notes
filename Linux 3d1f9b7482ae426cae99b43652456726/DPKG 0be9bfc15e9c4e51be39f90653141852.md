# DPKG

# What is DPKG?

In a nutshell, DPKG is a low-level system tool to extract, analyze, unpack, install or remove `.deb` files.

# Debian files

A deb file is an archive that contains data. It is used to easily distribute and install programs for Linux Debian and derivatives.

## Anatomy of a deb package

```bash
<name>_<version>-<revision>_<architecture>.deb
```

That is:

- `<name>` – the name of your application;
- `<version>` – the version number of your application;
- `<revision>` – the version number of the current deb package;
- `<architecture>` – the hardware architecture your program will be run on.

For example, suppose you want to release your program called hello, version 1.0, built for 64-bit ARM processors. Your deb file name would look something like `hello_1.0-1_arm64.deb`.

## Making the Debian package

Make sure you have the `dpkg-deb` program installed in your system
