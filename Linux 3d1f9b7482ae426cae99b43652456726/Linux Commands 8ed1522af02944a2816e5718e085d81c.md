# Linux Commands

## Create link

```bash
$ ln -s /root/B/publicB.pem
```

## Kill a process on a port

```bash
$ sudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -t -i:3000)
```

## List folders sizes

```bash
$ du -sh *
```

If you want to sort them, you can use the `sort` command.

```bash
$ du -hs * | sort -h
```

An alternative for the `du` is the `ncdu`:

```bash
$ ncdu
```

## Common tricks

Use -p flag when you want to create nested folders. For example:

```bash
$ mkdir -p a/b/c/d/e/f/g
```

## Tree the folders 2 levels

```bash
$ tree -L 2 .
```

# Tar

## Extracting `.tar` files

To extract a `tar.gz` file, use the --extract (`-x`) option and specify the archive file name after the f option:

```bash
$ tar -xf archive.tar.gz
```

The `-v` option will make the tar command more visible and print the names of the files being extracted on the terminal.

By default, tar will extract the archive contents in the current working directory. Use the `--directory` (`-C`) to extract archive files in a specific directory:

```bash
$ tar -xf archive.tar.gz -C /home/linuxize/files
```

When extracting files, you must provide their exact names including the path, as printed by `--list` (`-t`).

Extracting one or more directories from an archive is the same as extracting files:

```bash
$ tar -xf archive.tar.gz dir1 dir2Copy
```

# Network

## Block a server

Sometimes you may need to block the connection with specific servers. The file `/etc/hosts` is the one gathering information. If you want to block a server you should add lines to this file.

```jsx
# First open the file
$ sudo vim /etc/hosts

# Then Add these lines
0.0.0.0   www.example.com
0.0.0.0   example.com
::0       www.example.com
::0       example.com
```

## Set static IP addresses

There are some interfaces. You can change each interface using this command:

```bash
$ ifconfig <interface> <IP_Address> netmask <Netmask> up
```

For example it could be like this:

```bash
$ ifconfig wlan0 192.168.1.5 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
```

To set the default gateway IP:

```bash
$ route add default gw <IP_Address>
```
