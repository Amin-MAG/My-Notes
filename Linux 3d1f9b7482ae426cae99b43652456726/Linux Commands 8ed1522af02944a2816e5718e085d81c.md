# Linux Commands

## Create link

```bash
$ ln -s /root/B/publicB.pem
```

## Kill a process on a port

```bash
$ sudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -t -i:3000)
```

## List folders sizes

```bash
$ du -sh *
```

If you want to sort them, you can use the `sort` command.

```bash
$ du -hs * | sort -h
```

An alternative for the `du` is the `ncdu`:

```bash
$ ncdu
```

## Tree the folders 2 levels

```bash
$ tree -L 2 .
```

## Docker prune

The `docker image prune` command allows you to clean up unused images. By default, the `docker image prune` only cleans up *dangling* images. A dangling image is one that is not tagged and is not referenced by any container. To remove dangling images:

```bash
$ docker image prune
```

To remove all images which are not used by existing containers, use the `-a` flag:

```bash
 $ docker image prune -a
```

## Block a server

Sometimes you may need to block the connection with specific servers. The file `/etc/hosts` is the one gathering information. If you want to block a server you should add lines to this file.

```jsx
# First open the file
$ sudo vim /etc/hosts

# Then Add these lines
0.0.0.0   www.example.com
0.0.0.0   example.com
::0       www.example.com
::0       example.com
```
