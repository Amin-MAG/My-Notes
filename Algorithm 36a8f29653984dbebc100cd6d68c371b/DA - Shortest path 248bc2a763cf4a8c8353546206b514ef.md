        ❓We are given a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ on which each edge $(u, v) \in E(u,v) ∈ E$ has an associated value $r(u, v)$ that represents the reliability of a communication channel from vertex uu to vertex $v$$0≤r(u,v)≤1$$10≤r(u,v)≤1$) We interpret $r(u, v)$ as the probability that the channel from uu to $v$ will not fail, and we assume that these probabilities are independent. Give an efficient algorithm to find the most reliable path between two given vertices.
