## System Design Interview - Step By Step Process

In System design interviews, having a step-by-step framework can help us to manage our time and represent our thought processes. Here is a framework suggested by the ByteByte Go channel.

1. **Understand the problem and establish design scope (w=1)**: 
2. **Propose high-level design and get buy-in (w=4)**:
3. **Design Deep Dive (w=3)**: 
4. **Wrap Up (w=1)**: 

> **Note**: It's very important to keep in the mind to asked enough questions. Usually, the system design interview questions are vague and open ended. You have to ask questions and understand the importance of each factor of your solution design.
