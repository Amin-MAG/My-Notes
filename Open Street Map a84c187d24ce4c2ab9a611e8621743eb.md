# Open Street Map

# Overview

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a crowdsourced project which is popularly known as the [Wikipedia of the mapping world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap#cite_note-tc10-6). This is a map that is built by contributors from around the world, sharing information about places they know and love.

Most maps out there may be free for individuals to use, but use proprietary information and display a very limited view of the world, limited by the interests of the companies that make them available.

I believe that no one can know your vicinity better than you and this is the idea that OpenStreetMap is built on.
