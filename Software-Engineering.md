## Software Testing

Types of testing:

- Black Box, White Box, and Gray Box
- Functional and non-Functional

Solving Questions:

1. Architectural pattern with a rational reason
2. Component diagram and class diagram in the shape of architecture
3. Covering the scenarios
4. Fundamental design elements

You can read more about testing on the [testing](Testing.md) page.

## Miscellaneous

### ECA

ECA stands for Event Condition Action is a shortcut name for referring to the structure of active rules in event-driven
architecture and active database systems.

Such a rule traditionally consisted of three parts:

- The *event* part specifies the signal that triggers the invocation of the rule
- The *condition* part is a logical test that, if satisfied or evaluates to true, causes the action to be carried out
- The *action* part consists of updates or invocations on the local data
