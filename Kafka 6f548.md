# Kafka

Itâ€™s a Distributed stream processing system written in Scala and Java.

## Architecture

### Kafka server - Kafka broker

Producers and Consumers establish a TCP connection to the Kafka server or broker to subscribe or publish topics. 

Unlike RabitMq, the consumers pull topics from the broker.

### Partitions

Kafka uses the concept of sharding to distribute the database.
