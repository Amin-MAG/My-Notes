# K6

## Get started

```jsx
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export default function () {
  http.get('https://test.k6.io');
  sleep(1);
}
```

Then for running the test

```bash
k6 run script.js
# Run with more virtual users
# Running a 30-second, 10-VU load test
k6 run --vus 10 --duration 30s script.js
```

Code *inside* default is called "VU code", and is run over and over for as long as the test is running. Code *outside* of it is called "init code", and is run only once per VU.

```jsx
// init code

export default function () {
  // vu code
}
```

To give more parameters,

```js
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function () {
  const url = 'http://test.k6.io/login';
  const payload = JSON.stringify({
    email: 'aaa',
    password: 'bbb',
  });

  const params = {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  };

  http.post(url, payload, params);
}
```

### Options

You can set the options in the script instead of command.

```jsx
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';
export const options = {
  vus: 10,
  duration: '30s',
};
export default function () {
  http.get('http://test.k6.io');
  sleep(1);
}
```

You can even have some stages for the load testing

```jsx
// You can also have the VU level ramp up and down during the test
export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '7m', target: 3000 },
    { duration: '10m', target: 6000 },
    { duration: '4m', target: 5000 },
    { duration: '4m', target: 3000 },
  ],
};
```

## Summary Output

The final output of K6 contains a list of metrics. Some of them include both the accumulative and rate data.

1.  `data_received`: The total amount of data received from the server during the load test.
2.  `data_sent`: The total amount of data sent to the server during the load test.
3.  `http_req_blocked`: The average amount of time that requests spent waiting in a queue before being sent.
4.  `http_req_connecting`: The average amount of time that requests spent establishing a connection to the server.
5.  `http_req_duration`: The average time it took for a request to complete, from sending the request to receiving the response.
6.  `{ expected_response:true }`: The average time it took for a request that received an expected response to complete, measured in milliseconds (ms).
7.  `http_req_failed`: The percentage of requests that failed during the load test.
8.  `http_req_receiving`: The average amount of time that requests spent receiving data from the server.
9.  `http_req_sending`: The average amount of time that requests spent sending data to the server.
10.  `http_req_tls_handshaking`: The average amount of time that requests spent performing a TLS handshake.
11.  `http_req_waiting`: The average amount of time that requests spent waiting for a response from the server.
12.  `http_reqs`: The total number of HTTP requests sent during the load test.
13.  `iteration_duration`: The average duration of an iteration, from the start of one iteration to the start of the next iteration.
14.  `iterations`: The total number of iterations executed during the load test.
15.  `vus`: The number of virtual users (VUs) simulated during the load test.
16.  `vus_max`: The maximum number of VUs that were active at any point during the load test.

To have CSV or JSON output file for the summary you can use this command.

```bash
# CSV
k6 run --out csv=test_results.csv script.js

# JSON
k6 run --out json=test_results.json script.js
