# Testing

By adding `_test` to the end of another file, you can create tests for that code. You could use the built-in package named `testing` for testing!

The functions actually should start with the word `Test` just like below:

```go
func TestSpcuLogger(t *testing.T) {
	logger, err := NewLogger(SpcuLoggerConfig{})
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf(err.Error())
	}
	logger.Traceln("This is a trace log.")
	logger.Println("This is a print mode.")
	logger.Infoln("This is an information log.")
	logger.Warningln("This is a warning log.")
	logger.Warnln("This is a warn log.")
	logger.Debugln("This is a debug log.")
	logger.Errorln("This is an error log.")
}
```

As you can see, there is a `testing.T` as an argument.

# To run the tests

You can run all of your tests by using:

```bash
go test ./...
```

`./...` actually looks for `.go` files recursively.

If you want to see the results, you can use the `-v` flag:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```
