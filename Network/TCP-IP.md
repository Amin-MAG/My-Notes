# TCP/IP

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols that form the backbone of the Internet Including protocols like TCP, IP, ICMP, and others.

## IP

Responsible for addressing and routing packets so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination.

## TCP

Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication between applications.

## UDP

Offers connectionless, unreliable communication suitable for real-time applications.

## TCP/IP Model

- **Application Layer:** Provides network services directly to end-users or applications.
- **Transport Layer:** Responsible for end-to-end communication and error recovery (TCP and UDP reside here).
- **Internet Layer:** Manages packet routing and addressing (IP resides here).
- **Link Layer:** Handles physical transmission of data on the network.

## IP Addressing

- IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit) address formats.
- IPv4 addresses are written in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
- IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal notation (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

## Subnetting

Dividing an IP network into smaller sub-networks for efficient address space utilization.

## CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

IP addressing and routing methodology that allocates address space more flexibly than the older classful IP addressing.

## Routing

The process of forwarding packets from one network to another based on the destination IP address.

## ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

Maps an IP address to a physical MAC address on a local network.

## ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

Used for error reporting and diagnostics in IP networks (e.g., ping and traceroute).

## TCP Handshake

Three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) for establishing a reliable connection.

## Flow Control and Congestion Control

Mechanisms in TCP to manage the flow of data and handle congestion on the network.

## DNS

Resolves domain names to IP addresses.

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

Dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network

## NAT (Network Address Translation)

Translates private IP addresses to a public IP address for communication over the Internet.

## Firewall and Security

TCP/IP protocols play a crucial role in the implementation of firewalls and various security measures.

## IPv6 Transition

Due to the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, understanding the transition and coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6 is important.

## Network Troubleshooting Tools

Familiarity with tools like ping, traceroute, and Wireshark for analyzing and diagnosing network issues.

## Multicasting and Broadcasting

Understanding how multicast and broadcast communication work in IP networks.

## Socket Programming

Basics of socket programming for developing networked applications.

## TCP/IP Stack Implementations

Awareness of various implementations and their differences, including the Berkeley Sockets API.

## Network Time Protocol (NTP)

Used for time synchronization between devices on a network.
