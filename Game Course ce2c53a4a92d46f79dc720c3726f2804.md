Parallax is the optical phenomenon described as the apparent displacement of a distant object (with respect to a more distant background) when viewed from two different positions.

It gets smaller as it go further, and Its speed is going to be decreased. You can specify some layers for your scene and move the at decreasing speeds (depending on their depth). This will convey a sense of depth.
