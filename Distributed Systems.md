# Distributed Systems

# Compare with a centralized system

## Centralized systems

- Simpler
- Easier to understand
- Can be more faster for a single user

## Distributed systems

- More robust (It means that it can tolerate failures)
- More reliable (If a computer fails, you can still keep on working)
- More scalable (It means serving more users with a small number of computers)
- More complex but it worth

# Characteristic

- No shared clocks
- No shared memory
- Concurrency

# Notes

1. Distributed systems are dynamic (Allows the computers to join or leave)
2. Distributed systems are usually overlay networks (underlying networks)

Client-Server Model

We can divide everything between servers and clients. Clients need responses and requests from the servers. Servers respond to the incoming requests. Actually, it is based on a centralized structure.

Peer-To-Peer Model

This is the opposite of the Client-Server model and each one of the devices can be whether a server or a client. So that it is based on a distributed structure.
