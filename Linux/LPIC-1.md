## Operating System

The computer is all just some hardware. An operating system is software that manages hardware and its resources. It allocates resources to the applications.

## Firmware

Firmware is something between hardware and software. It enables that hardware to communicate to the operating system or other hardware.

The motherboard itself has firmware; the older version of this firmware was called BIOS. Nowadays, we have UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface). UEFI has a separate partition `/boot`.

## Peripheral Devices

### PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)

It enables us to add the hardware boards to the motherboard.

### Gpio (General Purpose Input Output)

## sysfs
