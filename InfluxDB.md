# InfluxDB

Itâ€™s an Open-Source time series database written in Go. The metrics from Telegraf are going to be stored here.

## Core Concepts

### Bucket

A bucket is like a database or a table. It contains time series data. We can set retention policies for buckets.

### Measurement

A measurement is like table name in RDB. It groups data based on their type.

### Tag

Tags are indexed key-value pairs used for filtering and grouping. They are like indexed columns in RDB.

### Field

Fields are key-value pairs that hold actual numeric or staring data. They are not indexed. So it is better to store metrics in fields, they are bad for filters. There can be multiple fields per measurement.

### Timestamp

Every point in InfluxDB has timestamp. 

### Line Protocol

This is a simple text format used to write data into InfluxDB

```influxdb
measurement,tag_key=tag_value field_key=field_value timestamp
```

for instance

```influxdb
weather,location=montreal temperature=21.5 1640995200
```
