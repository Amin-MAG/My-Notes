# SRE

Software Engineers that implement softwares to improve the reliability of services.

## System Reliability

What is the systems?

- Servers
- Cloud & Virtualization
- Databases
- Networks
- Applications & Services

Reliability of service is being accessible in different points of time and not to have down-time.

SRE tries automating the process of evaluating the effects that the changes will have. 

## SLA - Service Level Agreement

It is an agreement that decided by software engineers and the business people on how much reliability and accessibility the applications needs. This can be defined by down-time or even based on response time, or response status. The amount of error that is acceptable is called the error budget and teams can spend that amount of error budget to make more changes to their softwares.

## Use softwares

- Another task of SREs is using monitoring, alerting and logging services for having better visibility and observability of the services.
- They should make the duration of outage shorter and try that less users and services be affected.
- SREs have tasks about after-issue or after-outage analysis.

# SRE vs DevOps

Two side of same coin!

DevOps is a high level concept, SRE is a way to implement DevOps concepts.

DevOps mostly focus on speed of delivery (CI/CD), SREs focus on reliability.
