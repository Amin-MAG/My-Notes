# K6

## Get started

```jsx
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export default function () {
  http.get('https://test.k6.io');
  sleep(1);
}
```

Then for running the test

```bash
k6 run script.js
# Run with more virtual users
# Running a 30-second, 10-VU load test
k6 run --vus 10 --duration 30s script.js
```

Code *inside* default is called "VU code", and is run over and over for as long as the test is running. Code *outside* of it is called "init code", and is run only once per VU.

```jsx
// init code

export default function () {
  // vu code
}
```

### Options

You can set the options in the script instead of command.

```jsx
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';
export const options = {
  vus: 10,
  duration: '30s',
};
export default function () {
  http.get('http://test.k6.io');
  sleep(1);
}
```

You can even have some stages for the load testing

```jsx
// You can also have the VU level ramp up and down during the test
export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '30s', target: 20 },
    { duration: '1m30s', target: 10 },
    { duration: '20s', target: 0 },
  ],
};
```
