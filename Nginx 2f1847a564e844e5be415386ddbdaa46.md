# Config A Simple Web Server

The config file is in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

Simple configuration:

```bash
http {
	
	server{
		listen 8080;
		root /home/amin/static_site/;
	}

}

events { }
```

to serve some kind of data in a completely different location:

```bash
http {
	
	server{
		listen 8080;
		root /home/amin/static_site/;
	}

	location /images {
		root /home/amin/Pictures/;
	}

}

events { }
```
