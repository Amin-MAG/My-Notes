# 97 Things Every Cloud Engineer Should Know

##  What Is the Cloud?

The book defines the Characteristic of the Cloud Model based on The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in [“SP 800-145: The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing”](https://oreil.ly/umBJb).

- **On-demand Self-Service**:  Cloud resources of all varieties are available at a click of a button, or calling an API. So it provisions computing resources without requiring human intervention.
- **Broad Network Access**: Cloud services and resources should be accessible over a network, and users can connect to services via different platforms and devices.
- **Resource Pooling**: Cloud involves aggregation of computing resources in a multi-tenant environment, which can be shared among users.
- **Rapid Elasticity**: Cloud resources are designed and managed to scale down or up to meet the demand of users.
- **Measured Service**: Cloud measures the consumption of resources (which is usually one component of the cost). One of the cloud promises is that users pays for what they use.

### Service Models in the Clouds

- **SaaS**: Provides the customer an application or software running on cloud infrastructure. The user does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure such as networks, servers, operating system, or etc.
- **PaaS**: Provides the customers the capability of deploying their consumer-created or acquired application on cloud infrastructure. The user does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure such as networks, servers, operating system, but can control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment
- **IaaS**: Provides the customers to provision computing resources. The users can deploy softwares which can include operating systems or applications, although, still The consumers do not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure.

### Deployment Models

- **Private Cloud**: The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single company. It may exist on or off-premises. 
- **Community Cloud**: The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a set of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns. It may exist on or off-premises. 
- **Public Cloud**: The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for public use. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public).
