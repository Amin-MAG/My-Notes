It is going to focus on individual concepts and it‚Äôs not just generally speaking.

## Definition of Great Software

System Design: Maintainability, Flexibility, Extendability, Low Complexity

Non-Functional: Security, Performance & Efficiency, User Friendly

The definition of great software depends on the context of the software. Let‚Äôs see what do different programmers say about the Great Software.

The customer-friendly programmer

> The system do the things that the customer needs. (User Requirements, Not Buggy)
> 

The object-oriented programmer

> The system has Object-Oriented design and we follow the principles in that system. (DRY, Extendable design, Single Responsibility)
> 

The design-guru programmer

> Your objects in the system are loosely coupled and the system is open for extension but closed for modification.
> 

We have different stages to define the ‚ÄúGreat Software‚Äù, The essential part of being a Great Software is to be `customer-friendly` and do what is expecting to do. (For the projects that are not starting from scratch) If we rich this part and want to have a better and Great Software, we need to follow `object-oriented` designs to make our code more extendable and better for future usage. At the last step, we need to consider the coupling for our system. (`design-guru`)

The main answer or approach:

1. Make sure the software does what the customer wants
2. Apply good object-oriented principles
3. Strive for a maintainable, reusable design

## Maintainability

- It has a readable code base, So another developer can read and understand it.
- It‚Äôs easy to fix the bugs in the project
- The system can work and continue properly.

## Encapsulation

- Hides the details
- Hides complexity
- Has some interface to interact with it (public methods)

Components use the API to interact and communicate with this component, So any changes in this component shouldn‚Äôt break the others (If the APIs are designed perfectly).

We kinda limit the interaction between components.

## DRY

Against of Copy-Paste programming. Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself!

- It‚Äôs difficult to apply changes to the code
- Makes terrible bugs
- Makes our code less readable (It‚Äôs ugly)

## Information Expert

We have some classes and some methods, The Information Expert says ‚ÄúPut the methods in the classes which has the key and basic information for that method.‚Äù

## Regression testing

Your changes should be tested. The refactoring should comes with testing.

# Requirements

How to provide our software requirements, Stakeholders are the ones.

- Customers
- End User
- Development Team Members
- Management
- Technology providers

## Use cases

Use case describes all ways to achieve the goal from a specific starting point. It could be formal or informal.

Three part of a use case

- Clear Value: Every use case has a clear value to the system. It helps the users to achieve their goal.
- Start and Stop: Describe the start and stop state clearly and precisely.
- External Initiators

The constant thing in softwares is change üôÇ

# Software in Real World

## Analysis

- Studying the nature of something, determining its essential features and their relations.
- Exhibiting complex concepts or propositions
- Evaluation of an activity
