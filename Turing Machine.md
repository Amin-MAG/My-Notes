# TLA 2021 - Turing Machine

# Mathematics ➕

- Different kind of science
- Has lots of abstractions

## A formal system for mathematics 📏

Using alphabets or a set of meaningless symbols that can be manipulated by some rules.

1. Consistency

    if $2 + 2 = 4$ so $2 + 2  \neq 4$ is completely true

2. Completeness (Logical prove)
3. Decidability 🤔

    There should exist an effective procedure for deciding the truth or falsity of any mathematical system.

# Alan Turing 💭

So the third one is the one that Alan Turing cured about. Did there exist an effective procedure..? But the very first question was "What is an effective procedure?"

- Computer human
- Turing Machine based on computer human

    See the Turing machine model first and then continue.

- Easy but very powerful enough to computed everything that is possible.
- Programmable computer

    These statement tables can be represented by 0's and 1's. We can fit them in a programmable computer and then that computer is capable of doing many different tasks. 

    So an effective procedure was anything that could be computed by a Turing machine in an infinite amount of time.

- Halting

    At last he proved that the third one is not correct.

- Born of computer science 😍

## Turing Machine Model 💥

There is an infinite tape. There is also a single control unit that stands above specific location and can:

- Write something
- Read something
- Move Left
- Move write

## Turing Complete 💪

All programming languages such as C/C++, Java, etc. are kind of Turing complete. It means they solve any question that The Turing machine does.

To be Turing complete having these two things are essential.

1. Conditional branching
2. Arbitrary amount of memory

## Turing Test 🧪

Related to AI and it is a test that determine a bot can think like a human.

# Some Questions ❓

1. Strings that contains only 0's and 1's and they have exactly equal number of 0's and 1's.
2. Strings that have $2^n$ number of 0's. 
3. Strings like W#W that W contains 0's and 1's.
