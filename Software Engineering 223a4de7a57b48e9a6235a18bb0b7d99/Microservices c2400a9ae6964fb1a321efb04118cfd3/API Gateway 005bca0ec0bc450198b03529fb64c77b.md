# API Gateway

# What is the API Gateway?

An API gateway is an important concept in a microservices architecture. It forms an entry point for external clients(anything that is not part of the microservice system). It is a component that acts as an entry point for an application.

In other words, an API gateway is an API management server that has information about endpoints. It is also capable of performing authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and more.

To get a better picture of an API gateway, we need to know why it is essential to have an API gateway.

# Why do we need to use API Gateway?

To understand the need for an API gateway, let‚Äôs discuss a use case of an e-commerce application.

## **Case Study**

Consider a case study of a complex page( let‚Äôs say product page) of an e-commerce application. If we look at the below page of the Amazon product listing, we can see a lot of information needed to be rendered by this specific page.

![API%20Gateway%20005bca0ec0bc450198b03529fb64c77b/Untitled.png](API%20Gateway%20005bca0ec0bc450198b03529fb64c77b/Untitled.png)

For illustration purposes, let‚Äôs list all the microservices that we might need to render the above particular page.

Consider¬†**Search Product, Inventory, Shipping, Rating and Reviews, Recommendation Engine, Merchants, and Finance and Insurance**¬†are the different seven(7) microservices being used for rendering the above page.

P.S: Above seven(7) microservices are just an assumption to explain the API gateway concept. In reality, Amazon could have a different number of microservices.

### What is the problem?

Since these microservices have been deployed separately on a different server if a client wants to access these services, at least seven(7) calls have to be requested for a single page.

![API%20Gateway%20005bca0ec0bc450198b03529fb64c77b/Untitled%201.png](API%20Gateway%20005bca0ec0bc450198b03529fb64c77b/Untitled%201.png)

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a recommended approach because we have to make seven different calls, which would definitely impact performance, resource consumption, load time, etc. The client is also tightly coupled with all of the services, and suppose if we have to separate the Reviews and Rating microservices into two different services, we have to update the client code. The client has to make one call to get reviews, and one call to get ratings, which is really not the best way to deal with it.

### So what is the solution?

It is an API gateway.

In this approach, we have a layer between the client and microservices called an API gateway. It is a front-facing service for all of the microservices. Now any client who wants to access the microservices, the client has to call the API gateway. Now API gateway, in turn, makes a call to all of the microservices and gets whatever response we might need. This process is called API composition.

> In a nutshell, An API gateway sits in between the client and microservices and it acts as a gateway for all of the microservices.

Not only this but using an API Gateway benefits us in many ways.

## API Gateway Benefits

API gateways benefit us in implementing A/B testing, caching, managing access quotas, API health monitoring, API versioning, Chaos monkey testing, monetization, and a lot more. Let‚Äôs touch on some of the following benefits.

### Security

Every time an API call is performed, it has to access the services using public IP addresses. This exposes risks.

By switching on to API Gateways, these microservices can be accessed using private IP addresses only. This results in a more secure way of the transaction of data. Additionally, the usage of API Gateway also protects the data from malicious and DDoS attacks.

To ensure security, a¬†[TLS certificate](https://geekflare.com/free-ssl-tls-certificate/)¬†is necessary, API Gateway handles all of them by keeping all our APIs behind a single static IP or domain and helping protect them with keys, tokens, and IP filtering.

### Authentication, Authorization, and Fault Tolerance üîê

It is important to ensure authentication and authorization of the user who logs into applications. The API Gateway makes it easier by being a single entry point and satisfies all the requirements easily. Thus, it allows only authorized users to log in, and authenticated users to make changes, so fault tolerance is gained.

### Load Balancing and Routing üöè

In the case of multiple requests coming in and increasing traffic, API Gateway helps take care of it. It is done by creating multiple services and calling them on like Round-Robin. It can manage and routes the client requests based on user segmentation. Thus, different quality or rate of speed of content is provided for different users.

Consider a use case where two microservices are defined for returning low-quality images/videos and high-quality images/videos for a desktop and mobile, respectively. In this case, we can configure an API gateway in such a way that it acts as a router and if the request is coming from a mobile it will route that request to the low-quality images/videos service, and if the request is coming from the desktop, it can route to high-quality images/videos service. This routing can be done based on headers, paths, and params, etc.

### Insulation

If one or more microservices have been added to the application or removed, we will not update the client code. In this case, we need to perform some changes in the API gateway itself to make a call according to updated microservices.

### Reverse Proxy and Caching

Serving a static file (HTML, JS, CSS, fonts) by a microservice is not the best use, In this case, we can move these files to the API gateway.

An API gateway can keep hold of all the static contents and can directly serve the client. Similarly, consider a service that evaluates the trending products, and these trends are being calculated hourly or daily. So once the trend is calculated for the rest of the time, the service will return the same response repeatedly. In this case, an API gateway has a feature called¬†**response cache,**¬†where we can mention a URL and threshold time for which it needs to cache the responses.

### Protocol Adaptor

If we want to take advantage of protocol like web socket or a newer version of HTTP, i.e., HTTP/2, and even if our backend services are not ready or not compatible with HTTP/2 or web socket, an API gateway can take the responsibility of converting a newer to an older protocol. It can act as a protocol adaptor.
