# Design

We have system design and program design. In system design, we define our components and their relations to each other. In program design, We discuss the design patterns that can be used in writing codes. (function, classes, and...)

Designing needs knowledge and creativity. 

The key to good design is simplicity and simplicity itself comes from creativity. We should seek simplicity in our design because the best designs are easy to understand, implement, test, and maintain.

The environment can affect our design. For example, using a framework might enforce the developer to implement specific design and architecture. Other examples are databases or testing frameworks. 

So it is kind of important to consider the testing framework that we are going to use. Because it may affect our design.

Most of our decisions in the design and architectural level is emanated from these 2 principles.

1. Coupling (to decrease coupling)

    The components should have less relation and connectivity with each other as much as possible. The components are actually our features so they are kind of separate.  

2. Cohesion (to increase cohesion)

    The classes in a component should be highly connected and related to each other.

It is important to check these principles when you're designing. 

One way of representing our design is UML and there are many other ideas about this representation. Actually, It depends on the situation and maybe using another representation for our design is better that UML form.

# Component

A component is a replaceable part of a system that conforms to and provides the realization of a 
set of interfaces. It actually a subsystem. It is a distributable piece of implementation of a system.

We are able to make UML definition of a component.

Each component has 2 ports that represent the import and export APIs. The import port represents every APIs that pass in data to this component, And the export port actually represents all of the APIs that have been exposed from that component and we can use them.

Note: Each component talks to outside world just by their interfaces.

Set of component can be in a package. Also, Each one of the components may live on nodes.

# Architectural Styles

## Pipe

![Design%207dfad2ecbc7d48b9a985b7992566034d/Untitled%201.png](Design%207dfad2ecbc7d48b9a985b7992566034d/Untitled%201.png)

- It is used in compiler.
- Low-Coupling

    Note: Because of this it can have many variations like compilers.

- End-To-End testing is easy.
- It is not good for a parallel scenario.
- Error propagation issue.

## Client-Server (Centeralized)

![Design%207dfad2ecbc7d48b9a985b7992566034d/Untitled%202.png](Design%207dfad2ecbc7d48b9a985b7992566034d/Untitled%202.png)

Benefits:

- Low-Coupling
- Easy testing
- Security
    - Talking about insider attack. (Chain Attack)
- Simple

Disadvantages

- Scale-out
- Single point of failure
- Cost
- 

### Security

It is CIA.

- C for Confidentiality: Can not read our messages.
- I for Integrity: Can not change our files.
- A for Availability: Being available.

### Encryption

The best encryptions are AES and after that DES. Social media are using DES because the security on the other hand is to break the encryption to control the activities.

### Handle lots of request

Buffering and make a queue could be a solutions but it doesn't work usually. 

Another ways are:

- Scale-up is to improve the hardware.
- Scale-out is to add new servers.

## P2P (Distributed)

Each node could be client or server.

Disadvantages

- Black holes

## SEMI-P2P

We add some servers to resolve some issues in P2P.
