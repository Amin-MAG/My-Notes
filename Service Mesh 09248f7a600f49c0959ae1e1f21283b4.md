# Service Mesh

Service Mesh is a pattern or paradigm.

Service Mesh manages communication between Microservices. Each Microservice has its own business logic and are deployed on a platform like K8s cluster.

Migrating from Monolithic to Microservice challenges:

- Communication: Each one of these services needs to communicate with some other Microservices.
- Security: Once an attacker reach to the cluster, It can do anything because there is no security restriction inside the cluster. (Although we have firewall and some other restriction for securing the cluster from outside world)

Each single Microservice should have its:

- Own business logic
- Communication configurations
- Security logics
- Retry logic
- Metric & Tracing logic

Let’s just put all of these concerns except the business logic into a sidecar proxy section. The Control Plane of Service Mesh will inject these configurations to proxy section.

## Traffic Splitting

For new release versions, even though it passed the tests, it’s better to dedicate a small amount of traffic to this new version to make sure it works. For example, first release it for 10% of the users. (Canary Deployment)

With Service Mesh you can define WebServer Service which can do traffic splitting.

# Istio

Istio is a service mesh implementation.

- Configuration Discovery
- Generate Certificates for TLS communication, Acts like Certificate Authority
- Gathers metrics, Handle tracing

## Architecture

### Istiod

The control plane is also called istiod.

### Envoy Proxy

Proxy section name is called envoy proxy. 

### Ingress Gateway

Actually acts like load balancer and balance the traffic between the envoy proxies.
