# Embedded Systems

Embedded Systems 2022 IUST Course

# Chapter I

We have two types of computes

- Desktop-produced millions per year (PC, Servers, and notebooks)
- Embedded-produced billions per year (like Military and medical equipment)

## What are embedded systems?

1. Information processing system embedded into a larger product. (It is not the main goal)
2. The main reason for buying these systems are not data processing
3. They are such devices other than PCs, servers, and notebooks that:
   1. Electricity running through
   2. Perform something intelligent
4. The hardware/software form a component of a larger system but are concealed from the user.

> Usually, the output of the sensors is analog outputs.

## Characteristics of embedded systems

1. Dependability
2. Energy efficiency
3. Performance
4. Real-time: right answers arriving too late are still wrong.
5. Weight, Cost, Code-Size efficient
6. Dedicated user interface
7. Reactive: Frequently connected to the physical environment through sensors and actuators.
8. Hybrid (Analog + Digital parts)

The goals of designing a specific embedded system can be against each other.

Most real-time systems are embedded and most of the embedded systems are real-time.

- They can do variety of computational tasks.
- Functional Flexibility
- Low cost at high volumes
- Slow and power hungry: The elements are not optimized. They have more registers.

They have general data-path and ALU.

![Untitled](Embedded%20Systems/Untitled%203.png)

### Single-Purpose processors

### ASIPs processors

They are something between single and general purpose processors. ASIPs are designed for a particular class of applications having common characteristics.

They have optimized data-path.

They have special functional units.

### ASICs processors

They are designed to do exactly on program. (like Voice recorders or Bitcoin miners)

### ASICs VS General-Purpose

- Control logic is stored in memory and we need to fetch/decode instruction in the General-Purpose processors.
- the General-Purpose processors have more sets of logical units and registries.
- High NRE/sale-volume in General-Purpose processors.

## Memories

- It is an artifacts stores bits.
- It creates storage fabrics and the access logic

Write ability is about how fast the data is going to be written on that component.

- High end: like RAMs.
- Middle range: like FLASH, EEPROM
- Lower range: needs equipments to write data like EPROM, OTP ROM
- Low end: only stored during fabrication like Mask-programmed ROM

Storage permanence is about how long it holds the bits.

- High end: like Mask-programmed ROM
- Middle range: like NVRAM
- Lower range: the data is gone as soon as you turn off power supply like SRAM
- Low end: like DRAM

## Processor

The processor executes serial of instructions. There are three different kinds of instructions:

- Data: Move, arithmetic, or logical operations
- Control: Branch, loop, or subroutine call
- Interface: Load or store

We always want to improve the performance of the processor. 

- Caches
- Branch prediction
- Multiple/Out of order

Embedded Processors

## Automata Programming

The main problem of current programming languages is dealing with complex system behaviors. (Monitoring, Health care, etc.)
A solution is to provide automata for our system and generate the code using the available tools. 

### Components

- Control Object: Control the output amount of the water
- Control System: Check the height of the water

Control State: Like in Truing Machine.

Structure:

- Actions formed simultaneously
- Time and delays are set in the transitions.

### Language Specification for Embedded Systems

Completeness, Avoid the contradiction

- Hierarchy: Behavioral (Super-States), Structural (Like VHDL, Verilog)
- Timing behavior
- State-oriented behavior
- Event handling
  - External events (casued by the environment)
  - Internal Events (caused by the syste components)
- Support for a dependable system
- Exception-handling behavior

Available System: being awake watching for external events.
Safe System: Hardly fails and safely fails

## Model of computation - MOC

They are conceptual notions used to capture the system behavior.

- Sequential program model
- Object oriented - OO
- FSM
- DFG
- Petri net
- KPN
- CSP

## State-charts

Statecharts is a language for describing large, complex, and reactive systems.

![State-chart](Embedded%20Systems/statechart.png)

Statecharts VS FSM:

- Depth (abstraction)
- Orthogonality (concurrency)
- Broadcast communication (between states)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Outputs are global. (This message is a kind of communication between states)
</aside>

### Depth (!)

### Bottom-up clustering

![Refinement](Embedded%20Systems/refinement.png)

- D is a super state.
- The semantic of super state D: `A XOR B`

### Top-down refinement

The destination of a transition to a super state should be assigned to a basic state.

### Design modularity

#### Default State Mechanism

We can use the filled circle mechanism to handle this scenario. This super state is a state-less state.

#### History Mechanism

### Orthogonality (Concurrency)

![Orthogonality](Embedded%20Systems/orthogonality.png)

# Chapter IV - Scheduling

There are different kinds of classifications for scheduling.
- Centralized or Distributed
- Mono-processor or Multi-processor
- Online(dynamic) or Offline(static)

## Mono-Processor

### EDD - Earliest Due Date

It schedules the tasks in the way to have minimum $lateness_max$.

### EDF - Earliest Deadline First

The losest deadline should be executed first.

- It's preemptive.
- ach time a task arrives, it is inserted into a queue of ready tasks, sorted by their deadlines.
- It is optimal for periodic scheduling.
- It requires dynamic priority.
- EDF is the most optimal scheduling that doesn't have idle time.

Issues:

- It is less predictable.
- It provide less control over the execution.
- It has high overheads, since it should calculate the deadline.
- Domino failure: when multiple tasks ties in priorities, thereâ€™s a possibility of
failure.
- Transient Overload Problem
- Resource Sharing Problem
- Efficient Implementation Problem

### RM - Rate Monotonic

The task with smallest period should be executed first. The condition is

$$\mu = \Sigma \frac{c_i}{p} < n(2^{\frac{1}{n}}-1)$$

- It's preemptive.
- RM Algorithm exists in different operating systems. (Such as Windows NT)
- It is based on static priorities.

### LLF - Least Laxity/Slack First

The queue is sorted based on the `slack` parameter.

$$
SLACK = Deadline - ExecutionTime
$$


- Dynamically changing priority
- Preemptive: To allocate the CPU core to the ready task
- It is the optimal solution for uni-processor systems.
  - Some OS don't support calculating dynamic priority.
  - Fixed-Priority preemptive scheduling is commonly used in real-time systems.
- Needs the knowledge of execution time.
- Need lots of calculations to specify the priority

### LDF
- At run-time, the tasks are executed in from head to tail.
- LDF can be optimal for uni-processors.

## Multi-processor

One processor is a one-dimensional issue, But in multi-processor problem we have a 2 dimensions problem.

Classification of algorithms:

- Partintioned 
- Global
- Semi-Partitioned: It is hybrid

On important condition is $U < m$ and $u_{max} < m$.

#### Anormalies

- Dhall's effect - Periodic task sets with utilization close to 1 are unschedulable using global RM/EDF
- G-RM anormaly


### Partioned Scheduling

- Each of two dimentions is dealt with separately
- No task migration

All periodic tasks that are running on multiple cores have a common long period. 

$$
Utiliziation = \frac{C}{Priority}
$$

### Global Scheduling

- At each scheduling point, the scheduler decides when and where schedule at most $m$ tasks
- Task migrations are allowed
- The m higher priority tasks are executed on the $m$ processors

#### XX-US - RM/EF Utilization Threshold

Priority assignment depend on an utilization threshold  $Î¾$ If  $u_{max} > \xi$ then $T_i$ is assigned maximal priority. Else, $T_i$â€™s priority assigned as in original algorithm. (RM or EDF)

$$
u_{max} = \frac{C_i}{P_i}
$$

$\mu_{RM} = \frac{m}{3m-2}$
$\mu_{EDF} = \frac{m}{2m-1}$

For RM-US, condition is  $\mu = \Sigma \frac{c_i}{p} < \frac{m^2}{3m-2}$.
For EDF-US, condition is $\mu = \Sigma \frac{c_i}{p} < \frac{m^2}{2m-1}$.

- Not optimal
- Defies Dhall's effect

#### XX(k) - RM/EDF(k)

Task indices by increasing utilization. Priority assignment depends on a threshold on task index. Consider k, For $i < k$, priority is maximum, and for the rest of them the algorithm is RM or EDF. 

Note that, $EDF(k_{min})$ dominates $EDF(k=\frac{1}{2})$.

#### XX-ZL - RM/EDF Zero Laxity

Tasks with zero laxity have the highest priorities, if there is no zero laxity between remaining tasks then we use the common algorithm. 

- It has additional over-head for our system.
- It's dynamic job scheduling.
- It dominates G-EDF.
- Utilization bound is $\frac{m+1}{2}$

#### Pfair Algorithms

An algorithm that maximize the accumulated utilization or U.

$$\Sigma u_i < m)$$

- Full processor utilization!

##### Lag Function

It calculates the difference between real and fluid execution.

$$
Lag = FluidExecuation - RealTimeExecuation
$$

The actual fomula is

$$
lag(T_i, t) = \omega_it - \Sigma S(T_i, u)
$$

> Consider $\omega_i = u_i$

For calculating the Real time execution, $S(t_i, u)$ is $1$ if $T_i$ is executed in slot $u$ else $0$.

# Chapter V - Embedded Operating Systems

The big usage of Embedded systems are Real-time systems. We also call the Embedded operating systems, Real-Time operating systems.

There are classes of operating systems:

- Fast proprietary kernels - Although the top priority is the speed not being predictable. (not used for hard real-time) 
	- FreeRTOS
	- VxWORKS
- Extensions to standard OSes - A real-time kernel executes all real-time tasks and the Standard-OS as a single task (Hypervisor). Standard-OS manages non-real-time tasks. 
	- RT Linux
- Research OS

## Why to use embedded systems OS
- Same reason for why we use OS nowadays instead of traditional computers.
- Embedded systems usually don't need all of services of a standard OS.
	- There is timing uncertainty issue in common OS.
	- These additional features needs more resources like memory.
	- Being modular is the first priority in Embedded Systems desing. 
	- Common OS are not designed to be mission-critical. 

There are large variety of requirements and environments in Embedded Systems.

- Critical tasks - like medical or space shuttle systems
- Critical with mini tasks - like ABS
-  Lots of different non-critical tasks - smart phones

## Characteristics of an ES-OS

An ES-OS supports the construction of real-time systems.
- Configurability
- Ting behaviors are predictable in ES-OSs. (But they're not important in common OSs)
- Drivers are handled by tasks directly. (Not OS)
- Every task can perform an interrupt.
- Protection mechanisms are not always necessary.
- They can perform quasi-parallel tasks.
- CPU Scheduling is important.
- They have Inter-task communication.
- They support real-time clocks.
- Tasks Synchronizations is important.

### Configurability

It allows us to change the OS to fit all our needs.

- Remove unused libraries (e.g. by a linker)
- Using `#if` and `#ifdef`
- They usually have some configuration management tool, because manual changes might break the dependencies. 

## Tasks states

Tasks can be in Ready, Blocked or Running states.

- Scheduler selects a ready task and dispatch it. Then the task will go in running state (CPU is running the tasks). Preemption changes the state from running -> ready again.
- Tasks that are looking for an event (e.g. a resource allocation) will wait and go to blocked state. When the specific event comes, it signals the tasks and the state will be changed to ready.

## Threads

### Thread Control Block 

TCB stores the information needed to manage and schedule threads.  The operating system creates a new TCB for each thread.

- Program counter
- Priority 
- State
- Scheduling information
- Thread name

The TCBs are administerd in linked lists.

## FreeRTOS

- FreeRTOS contains some C codes like `tasks.c`, `timers.c`, and... containing usefull functions.
- FreeRTOS is configured by a header file called `FreeRTOSConfig.h`.
- Tasks are implemented as threads.

### Tasks States in FreeRTOS

- Block state
	- Temporal events
	- Synchronization events
- Suspend state - Pause a task
- Ready
- Running

### Some basic interfaces

Thread instantiation

```c
// You can use this function to create your tasks 
BaseType_t xTaskCreate( 
	TaskFunction_t pointerToTheFunction,
	const char* name,
	uint16_t stackDepthInWords,
	void *parameters,
	UBaseType_t priority,
	TaskHandle_t handle
)
```

Change the priority

```c
void vTaskPrioritySet(
	TaskHandle_t handle,
	UBaseType_t priority
)
```

Delete a task

```c
void vTaskDelete(TaskHandle_t handle)
```

We can use timer interface to create a delay.

```c
void vTaskDelay(TickType_t ticks)
```

### Interrupts

- Tasks will only be executed when there are no Interrupts Service Rourtine (ISR) running.
- They are short
