# Caching

## CPU

## Operating System

### Page Cache

### File System Cache like INode

## System Architecture

### Client-Side Cache 

Browsers, for example, cache the response of the server in themselves.

### CDN

The CDN first looks at its cache to see whether the request is available or not. It will send the request to the origin if the request does not exist in the cache.

### Load Balancer

Some kinds of load balancers cache the response of request which lead to less load on the origin server and less response time for users.

### Databases

Relational, Non-Relational, and any databases, in general, have a mechanism for caching.
