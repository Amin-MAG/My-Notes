# TestContainer

Testcontainers is a library that provides lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container for use in unit tests or automated integration tests. It simplifies the process of setting up and tearing down test environments, making it easier to write reliable and isolated tests that interact with external services or dependencies. 

Testcontainers handles the lifecycle of these containers, starting them before tests run and stopping them after tests complete, ensuring a clean and consistent testing environment.
