# WebSocket

WebSocket is a communication protocol, just like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). However, there are significant differences between the two.

HTTP is a request-response protocol commonly used for communication between web browsers and servers. It follows a stateless model, meaning that each request from a client is independent of previous requests.

## Websocat

It is a tool for testing and connecting to the WebSocket handlers.

```bash
websocat ws://localhost:8080/ws
```
