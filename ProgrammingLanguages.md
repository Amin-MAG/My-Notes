## Types of Programming Languages

If we all of programming languages different branches of a tree, There are two main branch.

1. **Imperative**: Giving explicit instructions
2. **Declarative**: Describing our goal

## Imperative Programming Languages

The main branches of this paradigm is 

- Structured
- Procedural
- Object Oriented

> **Note**: There are more paradigms than ones mentioned. 

## Declarative Programming Languages

The main branches of this paradigm is 

- Reactive
- Functional
- Logic

> **Note**: There are more paradigms than ones mentioned. 

### Functional

- **Functions can be used in unrestricted way**
	- Can pass a function into a function
	- Can return a function in a function
	- Can hold references to a function
- **Can create closures**: Functions that can be accessed and remember the scope around them. In closures, the function scope remains in the memory as long as the closure exists.

## Paradigms of Programming Languages

Each programming language can use some of the paradigms mentioned before in its language.

1. **Procedural Programming Languages**: These languages focus on procedures or routines, which are sequences of commands or statements to perform specific tasks. Examples include [C](C.md), Pascal, and BASIC.
2. **Functional Programming Languages**: Functional programming languages treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoid changing state and mutable data. Examples include Haskell, Lisp, and Scala.
3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Languages**: In OOP languages, data and behavior are encapsulated within objects. These languages emphasize concepts like classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Examples include Java, [CPP](CPP.md), and [Python](Python.md).
4. **Scripting Languages**: Scripting languages are designed for quick and easy tasks such as automating system administration tasks, web development, or rapid prototyping. Examples include JavaScript, [Python](Python.md), and Ruby.
5. **Markup Languages**: Markup languages are used to annotate text or data to provide instructions for interpretation by a computer. Examples include HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language).
6. **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)**: DSLs are designed for a specific domain or problem. They provide abstractions and syntax tailored to that domain, making it easier to express solutions. Examples include SQL (Structured Query Language) for database queries and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling web pages.
7. **Low-Level Languages**: Low-level languages are closer to machine code and hardware, providing more direct control over hardware resources. Examples include Assembly language and machine code.
8. **High-Level Languages**: High-level languages abstract away much of the complexity of low-level languages and are easier to read, write, and maintain. Examples include [Python](Python.md), Java, and C#.
9. **Compiled Languages**: Compiled languages are translated into machine code before execution, resulting in faster performance. Examples include [C](C.md), [CPP](CPP.md), and [Rust](Rust.md).
10. **Interpreted Languages**: Interpreted languages are executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, without the need for compilation. Examples include [Python](Python.md), JavaScript, and Ruby.
11. **Parallel Programming Languages**: These languages are designed for writing programs that execute multiple instructions simultaneously, taking advantage of parallel processing architectures. Examples include MPI (Message Passing Interface) and OpenMP.
12. **Constraint-based Languages**: Constraint programming languages are used to solve problems by specifying a set of constraints on the possible solutions. Examples include Prolog and CHR (Constraint Handling Rules).
