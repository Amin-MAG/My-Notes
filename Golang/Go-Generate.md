# Go Generate

In Go programming language, code generation is a technique used to automate the creation of code during the build process. Go provides several tools and libraries to support code generation, and one of them is the `go generate` command, which is a standard way to run code generators.

## Stringer

One popular code generation tool in the Go ecosystem is the `stringer` tool. The `stringer` tool is used to automate the creation of string methods for custom types.

```go
// color.go
package main

type Color int

const (
    Red Color = iota
    Green
    Blue
)
```

To generate the related files

```bash
go generate
```

After generating the files, you can use the `String()` method.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    c := Red
    fmt.Println(c.String()) // Output: Red
}
```
