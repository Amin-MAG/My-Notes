# Garbage Collection in Go

Go manages garbage collection (GC) automatically through its built-in garbage collector, which is part of the Go runtime. Garbage collection in Go is a form of automatic memory management that automatically reclaims memory that is no longer in use, preventing memory leaks and allowing developers to focus on writing code without explicitly managing memory allocation and deallocation.

1. **Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm**:
    
	- Go's garbage collector uses a concurrent mark-and-sweep algorithm to reclaim memory.
    - The algorithm consists of two main phases: marking and sweeping.
    - During the marking phase, the garbage collector traverses the object graph, starting from the roots (global variables, stack frames, etc.), and marks all reachable objects.
    - During the sweeping phase, the garbage collector sweeps through the heap and reclaims memory from unmarked objects.

2. **Concurrent Garbage Collection**:

	- Go's garbage collector runs concurrently with the application's execution, meaning that garbage collection can occur while the program is still running.
    - This minimizes the impact of garbage collection on application performance and reduces pauses.
    - Go's garbage collector uses a technique called "write barriers" to track modifications to pointers during concurrent garbage collection.

3. **Generational Garbage Collection**:
    
    - Go's garbage collector is generational, meaning that it divides objects into different generations based on their age.
    - Younger objects are assumed to have a shorter lifespan, so they are collected more frequently.
    - Objects that survive multiple garbage collection cycles are promoted to older generations.

4. **Garbage Collector Settings**:
    
    - Go provides several environment variables and runtime options to control garbage collection behavior, such as GOGC (garbage collection target percentage), GODEBUG (garbage collection debugging), and GOMAXPROCS (maximum number of operating system threads to use for parallel garbage collection).
