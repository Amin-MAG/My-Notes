# C library in Go

C library refers to the ability to interact with C code directly from Go programs. This functionality is primarily provided through the `cgo` tool, which allows Go code to call C functions and use C types.

## `cgo` Tool

The `cgo` tool allows Go code to import and use C libraries and call C functions directly. It also enables Go code to be called from C code. `cgo` generates Go code that interfaces with the C code and handles the necessary conversions between Go and C types.
