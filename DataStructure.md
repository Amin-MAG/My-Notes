# Data Structure

Some tricky data structures are used in databases.

## Skiplist

- In Redis, It is Implemented to create ordered data structures such as sorted sets and sorted lists.
- It is an alternative to a balanced tree

## Hash Index (Hash Table)

- It has a hash function that maps the key to the hashed value to quickly find the value in the hash table.
- It is widely used in databases.

## SS Table

## LSM Tree

- It is the backbone of some popular NoSQL databases like Cassandra.

## B-Tree

- It is used to efficiently store and read data.

## B+Tree

- All the data is stored in leaf nodes and internal nodes only hold keys.
- They are widely used in MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

## Inverted Index

- It is used to search and retrieve text from documents.
- It Creates a mapping of words to the documents in which they appear.
- It is obviously used in the Elastic Search database.

## Suffix Tree

- It is used in databases for efficient text searching.

## R-Tree

- It is used to efficiently store and retrieve spatial data in a database.
- It is widely used in PostGIS, mongoDB, and elastic search.
