# Graphs

The graphs are artifacts consisting of nodes(vertices) that are connected to each other with edges. The edges are either non-directional or directional.

## Adjacency list

It is a representation of graphs and specifies the connections between vertices.

```python
0: [1, 2, 3]
1: [2, 3]
2: [3]
3: [4]
4: [5]
5: [6]
6: []
```
