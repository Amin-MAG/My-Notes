# Embedded Systems

We have two types of computes

- Desktop-produced millions per year (PC, Servers, and notebooks)
- Embedded-produced billions per year (like Military and medical equipment)

## What are embedded systems?

1. Information processing system embedded into a larger product. 
2. The main reason for buying these systems are not data processing
3. They are such devices other than PCs, servers, and notebooks that:
    1. Electricity running through
    2. Perform something intelligent
4. The hardware/software form a component of a larger system but are concealed from the user.

> Usually, the output of the sensors is analog outputs.

## Characteristics of embedded systems

1. Dependability
2. Energy efficiency
3. Performance
4. Real-time: right answers arriving too late are still wrong.
5. Weight, Cost, Code-Size efficient
6. Dedicated user interface
7. Reactive: Frequently connected to the physical environment through sensors and actuators.
8. Hybrid (Analog + Digital parts)

The goals of designing a specific embedded system can be against each other.

Most of real-time systems are embedded and most of embedded systems are real-time.
